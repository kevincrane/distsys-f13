Distributed Systems, Fall 2013 (15-640)

Note to any future students who may find this: please do not copy any of this code. Go ahead and reference it for ideas all you like, but don't copy any of the code for yourself. The professors are smarter than that and some have software that's even smarter than them to catch duplicates (plus I don't want any angry teachers hunting me down). Enjoy!
